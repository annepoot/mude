    "    - <span style=\"color: red;\">*With higher values of $k$, we are averaging over a larger neighborhood. Intuitively, you can imagine that if our noise is high, generating multiple datasets of the same size will result in very different datasets, especially if $N$ is small. But over larger and larger neighborhoods, it makes sense that this noise we are adding tends to cancel out between points (remember the expected value of our noise is zero). It is therefore more likely that our resulting model will not change all that much for different datasets. This is the definition of a model with low variance (and therefore high bias!).*</span> \n",
    "* Why is the bias not exactly zero everywhere when se set $k=1$?\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color: red;\">*The bias should be zero at the locations of every one of the $N$ data points and when we take expectations over an infinite number of datasets. Take a look at what happens with the bias between data point locations and for different numbers of datasets.*</span>\n",
    "* Why does the bias increase when choosing a high frequency $freq$?\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color: red;\">*The complexity of our ground truth increases with frequency. So it makes sense that we would then need a more complex model to capture it properly. This in turn means models with the same $k$ will likely show an increase in bias. Note that this is not the case for $k=1$.*</span>\n",

    "So far, we have looked at our k-nearest neighbors regressor, which is relatively easy to understand and play around with. However, this method is not often used in practice, as it scales poorly for large datasets. Furthermore, computing the closest points becomes computationally expensive when considering multiple inputs (high dimensions). In a limited data setting, taking the average of the nearest neighbors will often lead to poor performance. k-nearest neighbors is also sensitive to outliers. In the following lecture, we will apply what we have learned to a different model, namely, linear regression."
